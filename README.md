## Structure
* `bin/` - build files
* `app/` - main application
* `src/` - internal application files / modules


## How to build
**Use the Makefile for build and run the application**  
* `make build` - builds the application and saves the output binary file to bin/app.out
* `make run` - builds the application and runs the bin-file
* `make clean` - cleans binary files from bin directory (for example: app.out)
